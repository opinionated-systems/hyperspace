Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.

Your task is to evaluate a student's answer to a mathematics problem and classify it as one of:
- "correct": The student's answer is fully correct and complete
- "incorrect": The student's answer is wrong or fundamentally flawed
- "partial": The student's answer has some correct elements but is incomplete or has significant gaps

PROBLEM:
```

OFFICIAL SOLUTION:
```
{solution}
```

GRADING GUIDELINES:
```
{grading_guidelines}
```

STUDENT'S ANSWER TO EVALUATE:
```
{student_answer}
```

Carefully compare the student's answer against the official solution and grading guidelines. Consider:
1. Does the student understand the core problem?
2. Are their key claims and reasoning correct?
3. Did they identify the right approach?
4. Are there gaps or errors in their solution?

Respond in JSON format with the following schema:
<json>
{{

}}

Your response must be exactly one of: "correct", "incorrect", or "partial"."""
