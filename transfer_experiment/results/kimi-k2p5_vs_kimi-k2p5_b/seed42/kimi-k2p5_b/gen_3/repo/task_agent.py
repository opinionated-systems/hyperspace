Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.

Your task is to grade a student's answer to a mathematical problem based on the provided solution and grading guidelines.

## Problem:
{problem}

## Official Solution:
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines:
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer:
{student_answer}

## Classification Criteria:

**"Correct"** - Use ONLY when:
- The student provides a complete, rigorous proof/solution
- All key steps are present and logically sound
- The answer matches the official solution's conclusion with proper justification
- No significant gaps or errors in reasoning

**"Incorrect"** - Use when:
- The student's answer is fundamentally wrong
- The approach is completely misguided
- The solution contains critical logical flaws
- The answer does not address the problem requirements

**"Partial"** - Use when:
- The student found a correct invariant or key insight but didn't complete the proof
- Significant progress was made but the solution is incomplete
- The approach is correct but missing crucial steps or cases
- The student identified the right strategy but failed to execute it fully

**"Almost"** - Use when:
- The solution is nearly complete with only minor technical errors
- The main idea is correct but there's a small gap in the argument
- The proof is valid except for a minor case or edge condition
- The student demonstrated deep understanding but made a small mistake

## Your Task:
1. Carefully analyze the student's answer against the official solution
2. Check if the grading guidelines mention specific criteria
3. Be STRICT about "Correct" - only use it for truly complete solutions
4. Be GENEROUS about "Partial" and "Almost" - recognize partial progress
5. Classify into EXACTLY ONE category

Respond in this exact JSON format:
<json>
{{
    "response": "Correct"
}}

OR

{{

</json>

OR

<json>
{{
    "response": "Partial"

OR

<json>
{{
    "response": "Almost"

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Use ONLY one of these four exact labels: "Correct", "Incorrect", "Partial", or "Almost"
2. Do not add any explanation in the response field - only the label
3. Include the <json> and </json> tags around your JSON response
4. When in doubt between "Correct" and "Partial", choose "Partial"
5. When in doubt between "Partial" and "Almost", choose "Partial" if major gaps exist, "Almost" if only minor issues remain"""
