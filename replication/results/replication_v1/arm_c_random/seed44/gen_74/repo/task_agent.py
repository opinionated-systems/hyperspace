"""
Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.
