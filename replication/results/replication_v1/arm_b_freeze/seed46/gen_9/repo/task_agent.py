Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.

{problem}

## Official Solution:
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines:

## Student's Answer:
{student_answer}

## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem, official solution, and grading guidelines.
2. Analyze the student's answer step by step.
3. Compare the student's approach with the official solution.
4. Check if the student has:
   - Understood the problem correctly
   - Used appropriate methods
   - Shown clear reasoning
   - Arrived at the correct answer
5. Assign a grade based on the grading guidelines.

Think through your evaluation carefully before providing the final grade.
