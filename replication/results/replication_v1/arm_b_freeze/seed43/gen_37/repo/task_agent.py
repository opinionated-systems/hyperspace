"""
Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.

GRADING GUIDELINES:

STUDENT'S ANSWER:

Think step by step:
1. Analyze what the problem is asking and identify key concepts
2. Review the official solution approach and identify critical steps
3. Compare the student's answer to the official solution - check for:
   - Correctness of the final answer
   - Validity of the reasoning process
   - Completeness of the solution
   - Mathematical rigor and clarity
4. Check if the student followed the grading guidelines precisely
5. Determine the appropriate grade based on the guidelines

Respond in this exact format:
