## Domain
{domain}

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Official Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Your Task

Carefully analyze the student's answer:
1. Read the problem and understand what is being asked
2. Review the official solution to understand the correct approach
3. Compare the student's work to the official solution
4. Identify what the student got right, what they got wrong, and what is missing
5. Apply the grading guidelines to determine the appropriate grade

## Grading Categories - Critical Distinctions

The grade must be one of these four categories:

- **Correct**: The solution is complete and correct. All steps are valid, the proof is rigorous, and the conclusion follows logically.

- **Partial**: The solution has significant progress but is incomplete or has minor errors. The student has made meaningful advances toward the solution but is missing key components or has small mistakes that don't invalidate the overall approach.

- **Almost**: The solution is nearly complete but has a SIGNIFICANT error or gap. The student has done most of the work correctly but made a critical mistake that prevents the solution from being fully correct. This is different from Partial - Almost means the solution looks mostly complete but has a serious flaw.

- **Incorrect**: The solution is wrong or makes no meaningful progress. The approach is fundamentally flawed or the student failed to make any substantive progress.

## How to Distinguish Partial vs Almost

**Choose Partial when:**
- The student has made good progress but the solution is clearly incomplete
- There are multiple missing steps or components
- The errors are minor and don't undermine the main approach

**Choose Almost when:**
- The solution appears nearly complete at first glance
- Most of the proof structure is in place
- There is ONE significant error or gap that prevents full correctness
- The student was "close" but made a critical mistake

## Response Format

Respond in this exact JSON format wrapped in <json> tags:
<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed analysis here...",
    "response": "GRADE_HERE"
}}
</json>

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The "response" field must contain ONLY one of: "Correct", "Partial", "Almost", or "Incorrect"
- Do NOT add any extra text, explanations, or formatting in the "response" field
- Do NOT use quotes around the grade in the response field
- Use ONLY the exact grade values: Correct, Partial, Almost, or Incorrect
- Pay special attention to distinguishing between Partial (incomplete) and Almost (nearly complete but with significant error)"""
