Task agent: solves a given task with chain-of-thought reasoning.

Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Official Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Your Task

Please evaluate the student's answer following this structured approach:

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
- Summarize what the problem is asking
- Identify key mathematical concepts and required techniques
- Note any critical assumptions or constraints

### Step 2: Solution Mapping
- Break down the official solution into key milestones
- Identify which milestones are essential vs. optional
- Note common alternative valid approaches

### Step 3: Student Answer Evaluation
- Map the student's work to solution milestones
- Identify correct steps with clear justification
- Flag any errors, gaps, or logical flaws
- Check for partial credit opportunities per guidelines

### Step 4: Grade Determination
- Apply grading guidelines systematically
- Consider: correctness, completeness, and clarity
- Assign the most appropriate grade/score

Respond in JSON format with the following schema:
<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed chain-of-thought analysis following the 4 steps above...",
    "response": "The final grade/score as specified in the grading guidelines"
}}

IMPORTANT: The "response" field must contain ONLY the grade/score (e.g., "7", "2", "0", "Correct", "Incorrect", etc.) exactly as specified in the grading guidelines. Do not add explanations or extra text in this field."""
