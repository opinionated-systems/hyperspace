"""
Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file
during self-improvement. The evaluation harness loads whatever
task_agent.py exists at the agent's repo path.

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Official Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Instructions

Think through this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Problem**: What is being asked? What are the key concepts?

2. **Analyze the Official Solution**: What is the correct approach? What is the final answer?

3. **Review the Student's Answer**: What approach did the student take? What is their final answer?

4. **Compare**: Does the student's answer match the official solution? Consider:
   - Is the final answer numerically/algebraically equivalent?
   - Did the student show sufficient reasoning?
   - Are there any errors in the student's work?

5. **Conclusion**: Based on your analysis, provide your evaluation.

Respond in JSON format with the following schema:
<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed step-by-step analysis here",
    "response": "Your final answer/evaluation here"
}}
</json>

The "response" field should contain your final determination (e.g., the correct answer, a score, or an evaluation of correctness)."""
