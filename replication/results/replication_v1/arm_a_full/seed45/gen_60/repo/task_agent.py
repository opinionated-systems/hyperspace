## Problem Statement

## Official Solution

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Instructions

Think through this step-by-step, providing detailed analysis at each stage:

### Stage 1: Problem Understanding
- What is the core question being asked?
- What are the key mathematical concepts, theorems, and techniques required?
- What constraints or conditions must be satisfied?

### Stage 2: Official Solution Analysis
- What is the canonical approach to solving this problem?
- What is the definitive final answer (in exact form)?
- What are the critical proof steps or logical deductions that must be present?
- Are there alternative valid approaches?

### Stage 3: Student Answer Review
- What approach did the student attempt?
- What is the student's final answer (exactly as stated)?
- What key steps did the student include or omit?
- What mathematical reasoning did the student demonstrate?

### Stage 4: Detailed Comparison
Evaluate the student's answer against these criteria:

**Answer Correctness:**
- Is the student's final answer mathematically equivalent to the official solution?
- Did the student arrive at the correct numerical/algebraic result?
- Are there any sign errors, calculation mistakes, or algebraic errors?

**Reasoning Quality:**
- Did the student demonstrate sound mathematical logic?
- Are the proof steps valid and well-justified?
- Did the student cite appropriate theorems and apply them correctly?
- Are there logical gaps or circular reasoning?

**Completeness:**
- Did the student address all parts of the problem?
- Is the solution fully worked out or are there missing steps?
- Did the student show sufficient work to justify their conclusion?

**Presentation:**
- Is the solution clearly organized and easy to follow?
- Did the student define variables and explain their notation?
- Are there any ambiguous or unclear statements?

### Stage 5: Grade Assignment
Based on your comprehensive analysis, assign one of these grades:

- **correct**: The answer is fully correct with proper reasoning, all critical steps are justified, the final answer matches the official solution, and the solution is complete.
- **incorrect**: The answer contains critical errors, uses fundamentally incorrect methods, has a wrong final answer, or demonstrates major logical flaws.
- **partial**: The answer has valid elements but is incomplete, contains minor errors, lacks proper justification for key steps, or only partially matches the official solution.

## Response Format

You must respond with a valid JSON object enclosed in <json> tags:

<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Provide your detailed step-by-step analysis here. Include specific observations about the student's mathematical reasoning, any errors found, comparison with the official solution, and justification for your grade assignment. Be thorough and cite specific elements from the student's work.",
    "response": "correct"
}}
</json>

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. The "response" field MUST contain exactly one of: "correct", "incorrect", or "partial" (all lowercase, no quotes around the value in the field)
2. The "reasoning" field must contain your complete analysis
3. Do not include any text outside the JSON tags
4. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted"""
