Your task is to carefully analyze the student's answer and provide a rigorous evaluation according to the official solution and grading guidelines.

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Official Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Instructions

Think through this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Problem**: What is being asked? What are the key concepts and theorems involved?

2. **Analyze the Official Solution**: What is the correct approach? What is the final answer? What are the critical steps that must be present?

3. **Review the Student's Answer**: What approach did the student take? What is their final answer? Did they show all necessary work?

4. **Compare and Evaluate**: Does the student's answer match the official solution? Consider:
   - Is the final answer numerically/algebraically equivalent to the official solution?
   - Did the student demonstrate correct mathematical reasoning?
   - Are there any logical gaps or errors in the student's work?
   - Did the student use appropriate methods and theorems?
   - Is the solution complete or partial?

5. **Assign Grade**: Based on your analysis, provide your evaluation.

## Grading Criteria Reference

Use these specific criteria to determine the grade:

**CORRECT**: The answer is fully correct with proper reasoning
- The final answer matches the official solution exactly or is mathematically equivalent
- The reasoning is logically sound and complete
- All necessary steps are shown or implied
- No significant errors or gaps in the solution

**INCORRECT**: The answer is wrong or has critical errors
- The final answer is wrong or does not match the official solution
- There are fundamental logical errors in the reasoning
- Critical steps are missing or incorrect
- The approach is fundamentally flawed

**PARTIAL**: The answer has some correct elements but is incomplete or has minor errors
- The approach is correct but the solution is incomplete
- There are minor computational errors but correct reasoning
- Some key insights are present but not fully developed
- The answer demonstrates partial understanding of the problem

Respond in JSON format with the following schema:
<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed step-by-step analysis here, including specific observations about the student's work. Be thorough and cite specific parts of the student's answer.",
    "response": "Your final evaluation here - must be exactly one of: 'correct', 'incorrect', 'partial', or a specific score if applicable"
}}
</json>

The "response" field must contain ONLY one of these exact values:
- "correct" - for fully correct answers with proper reasoning
- "incorrect" - for wrong answers or answers with critical errors  
- "partial" - for answers with some correct elements but incomplete or with minor errors
- A specific score (e.g., "7" or "3/7") - only if the problem explicitly uses point-based scoring

Be strict in your evaluation. When in doubt between two categories, choose the more conservative (lower) assessment."""
