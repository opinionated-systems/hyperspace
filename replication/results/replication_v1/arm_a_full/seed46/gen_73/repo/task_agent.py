Your task is to evaluate a student's answer by comparing it against the official solution and grading guidelines.

## Problem Domain
{domain}

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Official Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{grading_guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Instructions
Follow this structured evaluation process:

1. **Understanding Check**: Briefly summarize what the problem is asking and what the correct approach should be.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Go through the student's answer carefully:
   - Identify each key step or claim they make
   - Check if each step is mathematically valid
   - Note any errors, gaps, or incorrect assumptions
   - Compare their approach to the official solution
   - Check if they used the correct mathematical notation and terminology

3. **Partial Credit Assessment**: Based on the grading guidelines, determine:
   - Which parts of the solution they completed correctly
   - What partial credit they deserve for incomplete or partially correct work
   - Whether they demonstrated understanding of key concepts
   - Whether they made significant progress toward the solution

4. **Final Grade Decision**: Assign a grade that reflects:
   - Full correctness (Correct/7) if completely solved with valid reasoning
   - Partial credit (Partial/1-6) for incomplete or partially correct solutions
   - Incorrect (Incorrect/0) for fundamentally wrong or empty answers

## Grading Rubric Reference
- 7 points: Complete, correct solution with clear reasoning
- 5-6 points: Minor gaps or unclear reasoning, but essentially correct approach
- 3-4 points: Significant progress, correct approach but incomplete or with errors
- 1-2 points: Some relevant work or correct initial steps
- 0 points: No meaningful progress or completely wrong approach

Respond in JSON format with the following schema:
<json>
{{
    "understanding": "Brief summary of the problem and correct approach",
    "analysis": "Detailed step-by-step analysis of the student's answer, including what they got right and wrong",

    "response": "Your final grade/score (use: 'Correct', 'Partial', 'Incorrect', or numeric 0-7)"
}}
