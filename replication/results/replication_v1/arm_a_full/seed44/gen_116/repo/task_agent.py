Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Reimplemented from facebookresearch/HyperAgents task_agent.py.
Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file

Your task is to grade a student's answer to an IMO-level mathematics problem. You must carefully analyze:
1. The problem statement
2. The official solution
3. The grading guidelines (rubric)
4. The student's submitted answer

Then provide your evaluation in the specified JSON format.

PROBLEM DOMAIN: {domain}

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
```
{problem}
```

OFFICIAL SOLUTION:
```
{solution}
```

GRADING GUIDELINES (RUBRIC):
```
{grading_guidelines}
```

STUDENT'S ANSWER:
```
{student_answer}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Study the official solution to understand the correct approach.
3. Review the grading guidelines to understand how points are awarded.
4. Analyze the student's answer step by step:
   - Did they understand the problem correctly?
   - Did they use the right approach?
   - Are their calculations correct?
   - Did they provide a complete proof/solution?
   - Where did they make errors, if any?
5. Assign a score based on the grading guidelines.

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object wrapped in <json> tags. Do not include any text outside the JSON tags.

Respond in the following exact format:
<json>
{{
    "response": <your numerical score or evaluation>,
    "reasoning": <detailed explanation of your grading decision>,
    "confidence": <confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0>,
    "error_analysis": <description of any errors found in the student's work, or "None" if correct>
}}
</json>

The "response" field should contain your final grading decision (typically a number or specific evaluation string as specified in the grading guidelines).

The "reasoning" field should contain a detailed explanation of why you assigned this score, referencing specific parts of the student's solution and the grading guidelines.

The "confidence" field should be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident you are in your grading decision (1.0 = very confident, 0.0 = not confident at all).

The "error_analysis" field should describe any errors or misconceptions in the student's work, or "None" if the solution is fully correct.

Examples of valid responses:
- For a numeric score: <json>{{"response": 7, "reasoning": "The student correctly identified the key insight and provided a complete proof.", "confidence": 0.95, "error_analysis": "None"}}</json>
- For a partial score: <json>{{"response": 3, "reasoning": "The student had the right approach but made a calculation error in step 3.", "confidence": 0.85, "error_analysis": "Incorrect calculation: 2+2 was computed as 5 instead of 4"}}</json>
- For a string evaluation: <json>{{"response": "Correct", "reasoning": "All steps are valid and the conclusion follows logically.", "confidence": 0.98, "error_analysis": "None"}}</json>

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted with no trailing commas or syntax errors.

FINAL CHECK: Before responding, verify that:
1. Your JSON is valid and parseable
2. All four fields (response, reasoning, confidence, error_analysis) are present
3. The "response" field contains only the final answer (number, string, or boolean)
4. The "confidence" field is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
5. There are no extra fields or comments in the JSON
6. The JSON is properly wrapped in <json>...</json> tags"""
