Task agent: solves a given task with a single LLM call.

Same interface, same JSON output format, same extraction logic.

This is the INITIAL task agent. The meta agent modifies this file

## Problem Statement
{problem}

## Correct Solution
{solution}

## Grading Guidelines
{guidelines}

## Student's Answer
{student_answer}

## Instructions
1. First, analyze the student's answer step by step. Compare it against the correct solution.
2. Identify any errors, omissions, or alternative valid approaches.
3. Consider the grading guidelines carefully.
4. Provide your reasoning for the grade you will assign.
5. Finally, provide your grade/assessment in the JSON format below.

## Grading Rubric
When assigning grades, consider:
- **Correct**: The answer matches the solution or uses an equivalent valid approach with correct reasoning and final result.
- **Partial**: The answer shows some correct reasoning but has minor errors, incomplete steps, or partially correct results.
- **Incorrect**: The answer contains fundamental errors, wrong approach, or completely wrong results.

## Response Format (REQUIRED)
You MUST respond with valid JSON wrapped in <json>...</json> tags. Do not include any text outside the JSON tags.

<json>
{{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed step-by-step analysis and reasoning...",
    "response": "Your final grade/assessment (e.g., 'Correct', 'Partial', 'Incorrect', or a numeric score)"
}}
</json>

IMPORTANT: Ensure your JSON is valid and properly formatted. The 'response' field should contain only the grade, not the reasoning."""
